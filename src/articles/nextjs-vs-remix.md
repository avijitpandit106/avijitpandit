# Introduction

Choosing between **Next.js** and **Remix** depends heavily on your projectâ€™s needs. While both are React-based frameworks, their philosophies and features differ significantly.

In this article, we'll explore key differences between them and when to choose which.

---

## Rendering Strategies

### Next.js

Next.js supports:

- **Static Generation (SSG)**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**

Here's an example of `getStaticProps` in Next.js:

```tsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();
  return {
    props: { posts },
  };
}
```

### Remix

Remix leans into **web standards** and prioritizes performance by using native **browser APIs** and **streaming** for faster Time to First Byte (TTFB).

You use loaders instead:

```tsx
export const loader = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();
  return json(posts);
};
```

> **Pro Tip:** Remix doesnâ€™t require a bundler for routingâ€”everything is file-based and follows conventional patterns.

---

## Routing and Layouts

Both frameworks offer **file-based routing**, but Remix provides **nested routes** and layouts more elegantly.

- **Next.js** uses a `pages` or `app` directory with explicit layout components.
- **Remix** supports nested layouts and routes natively with better co-location of logic.

---

## Image Optimization

Next.js includes built-in image optimization via the `<Image />` component. Remix recommends using external services like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).

### Example in Next.js:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/blog1.jpg"
  alt="Framework Comparison"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  className="rounded-lg shadow"
/>
```

---

## SEO & Metadata

Both frameworks allow meta handling, but Next.js 13+ provides a powerful `metadata` API in the `app` directory.

Remix uses route-level meta functions:

```tsx
export function meta() {
  return {
    title: 'Next.js vs Remix',
    description: 'Compare popular React frameworks',
  };
}
```

---

## Conclusion

Both frameworks are powerful, and your choice depends on:

- Project complexity
- Performance goals
- Hosting environment
- Familiarity with web fundamentals

> **Use Next.js** if you prefer a mature ecosystem and powerful hybrid rendering.

> **Use Remix** if you're building performance-first apps and love working with web APIs directly.
